Project for studies.

Simple Gui-based model which allows to export Excel xlsx format (limited) into mySQL DB data and vice versa.
It allows to import from and export to Excel<->MySql, add modify and remove data manually from implemented GUI.
It also allows to calculate basic multi-criteria optimisation, such as Topsis and Rsm on given MySql data.

Rsm creator was not me, but him: https://github.com/plizonczyk.

Repository was fully recreated, as it contained several fragile personal details thoughout many commits.
The easiest way to purge it is to push everything as one commit :)

This is only project to pass some lectures, please be aware of that before using it anywhere.
There are many PEP violations -- dont be mad :)

Everything is based on PyQt.
